# MITRE ElectionGuard Verifier

[ElectionGuard](https://www.electionguard.vote/) is a software system
designed to make voting more secure, transparent and accessible.
ElectionGuard uses cryptography to ensure that

 - voters can verify that their own selections have been correctly
   recorded, and

 - anyone can verify that the recorded votes have been correctly
   tallied.

The MITRE ElectionGuard Verifier provides the means to validate
specification
[version 1.0 ElectionGuard](https://www.electionguard.vote/spec/)
election records that use version 0.95 data formats in an easy to use
package.  This is a preview release, and the verifier will be updated
sometime after version 1.0 sample data becomes available
[here](https://github.com/microsoft/electionguard).

The MITRE ElectionGuard Verifier is written in the
[Julia](https://julialang.org/) programming language.  Follow the
instructions at the Julia web site to download and install the system
on your computer.
